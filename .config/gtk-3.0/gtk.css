 * This is a workaround for gvim for the behaviour that falls out of its

 * that the window size is not multiple of the characters rendered it will
 * leave pixels around the bottom right edge at their default values. That
 * value is determined by gtk3 and matches the window default background
 * colour. This setting makes that match the vim colorscheme.
